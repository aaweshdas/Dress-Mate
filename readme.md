## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally, based on the following structure:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaweshdas/Dress-Mate.git
```
Then, navigate into the newly created project folder:
```bash
cd Dress-Mate
```


### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later) and **NPM** (v10 or later)
- **MongoDB Community Server** & **MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`)** installed and running.
- An **API Key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) with the **One Call API 3.0** plan subscribed (the free tier is sufficient).

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate into the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Inside the `server` folder, create a file named `.env` and add the following variables.

    ```
    # Your MongoDB connection string (update 'veda' if needed)
    MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://subhankarDas:Subhankar18yrs%23@cluster0.vjgjl.mongodb.net/test"

    # A long, random, and secret string for JWT
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-change-this"

    # Your API key from OpenWeatherMap
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="paste_your_api_key_here"    or use this    423385e62f1bb4b32a432c487a3db870

    PORT=3500
    ```

    > **How to Generate a `JWT_SECRET`** üîë
    > This must be a long, random string. You can generate one from your terminal:
    > ```bash
    > node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
    > ```
    > Copy the output and paste it as the value for `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` file.


4.  **Start the backend server:**
    While still inside the `server` directory, run:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    You should see confirmation messages in your terminal:
    `Server running on port 3500`
    `MongoDB Connected`

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  **No installation is needed** for the frontend.
2.  Open the **`login.html`** file in your browser to begin the application. It's recommended to use a live server extension in your code editor (like "Live Server" in VS Code) for the best experience.
